A multipurpose Discord bot for fun, utility, and more, coded in discord.js.

## Description
Kendra is an **actively developed bot** that not only has fun, moderation, utility commands, but a phone command for calling other servers, and combines features from popular bots. New commands are added to Kendra often.

## How to install
*Note: You need to have Node.js 8 or newer installed before you can start the bot, and it is recommended to have a 64-bit operating system when running it*

1. Install a program that can clone GitHub repositories, such as Git Bash for Windows
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/blueboomer76/kendraBot.git`
3. Open Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (Mac), or other program and run `cd ../path/to/directory` or similar if necessary to move the directory to the kendraBot repository.
4. Rename the file `config.example.json` to `config.json` and replace everything in angle braces (`<` and `>`) with the correct values. If you do not have a value available, put `null` in place of it. (For `ideaWebhook`, put `null` as a value for that key.)
5. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
6. Run `node index.js`

You can update the bot by running `git pull` to get the latest features.
